## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Clone this repo into your desired directory
  ```git clone git@github.com:cyonii/movie-face.git```




### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed in your computer as this app is built on it.

### Setup
- Change into the project directory by running
  ```cd movie-face```
  *assuming you're in the same location where you ran the `clone` command.*
- Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project, inside it add your TMDB API key like this **```REACT_APP_TMBD_API_KEY=<api_key>```** and save.

### Install
- Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.

### Usage
- Run `npm run start` to start the app - all things being equal, the app should open in your default browser after a while. In case that doesn't happen for whatever reason, you can head over to your browser and go to **`localhost:3000`**

### Run tests
- Run `npm run test` to run tests

### Deployment
You can check out Heroku's or Netlify's docs on how to deploy a React app in their clouds.
